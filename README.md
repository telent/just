## TO DO

- deal with unsuported mime types (pass to download manager?)
- find out if it's going to eat cpu like luakit does
- some kind of bookmarks/favourites/pinned tabs/memory of visited sites
- warning for insecure sites
- try video and audio
- does it save passwords? find out! where?
- better icon for overview button
